        Unobtanium is a barrel-aged English-style Old Ale that ages for six months in a bourbon barrel, soaking up all sorts of amazing whiskey character as well as hints of oak and vanilla. The name was taken from an old aerospace/engineering term for a specific material or object (often imaginary, impossible or highly improbable to obtain) needed to complete any given project. And, before you ask, we did not take the name from the elusive metal in Avatar. James Cameron reportedly named the substance as an inside joke to his fellow techie/gear-heads. Our version is much tastier, though.

Anchorage Bitter Monk Belgian Style Double IPA,3.99,100,99,9%,270,"
        Double IPA aged in French oak Chardonnay barrels with Brett. Deep within the tortured aberrations of a monk’s mind there lay a concept of a Holy Grail of beer -- a beer oft imagined but never tasted, strived for but never achieved. It’s Belgian heritage manifested in its yeasty complexity, softened and rounded in its cooperage Français and made to sparkle like the stars first seen by his distant predecessor Dom Pérignon.
Bitter Monk Belgian Double IPA is such a beer. Redolent of citrusy hop bittering and massive malt infusion, this is a beer to ponder, to sip, and, even for a monk, to dream. Why then is the monk so bitter? What provokes that sly smile? What is he wearing under that flowing robe? A triple-fermented beer gives him three times the mystery. Remember, anything worth doing is worth over doing. Nothing exceeds like excess. Even for the cloistered.
And what rough monk, his hour come round at last, slinks slowly toward Brussels to be reborn.

No, but close; Hop Knot is around 6% and Double Knot is around 9.2%.  So, did we double the hops?  Well, yes!  We did!  Hop Knot uses around 3.5 lbs per barrel and Double Knot is around 7.5 lbs per barrel (Okay, a little more than double, don’t sue us).  That’s really the main difference between the two; slightly higher alcohol content and twice the hops. But what a difference if you’re a true hop-head.

         Pliny the Elder was a Roman naturalist, scholar, historian, traveler, officer, and writer. Although not considered his most important work, Pliny and his contemporaries created the botanical name for hops, ""lupus Salictarius"", meaning wolf among scrubs."" Hops at that time grew wild among willows, much like a wolf in the forest. Later the current botanical name, humulus Lupulus, was adopted. Pliny died in 79 AD while observing the eruption of Mount Vesuvius. He was immortalized by his nephew, Pliny the Younger, who continued his uncle’s legacy by documenting much of what he observed during the eruption of Mount Vesuvius. Pliny the Elder, the beer, is brewed with 40% more malt and over twice the amount of hops as compared to our already hoppy IPA.

        We often use Speedway Stout as a jet-black canvas for homages to things we hold dear, whether it’s artisan coffee, a favorite edible or sumptuous flavor combination. The most recent variation of our celebrated imperial stout honors the culinary character of the Hawaiian Islands by combining the lush sweetness of coconut with vanilla and Ka’u coffee. Named after the region of Hawaii from which it hails, Ka’u is produced from some of the world’s rarest coffee beans. Slow-grown beneficiaries of nutrient-rich volcanic soil and idyllic climate, Ka’u offers nuances of caramel and hazelnut plus a soft floral character, all of which marry seamlessly with natural sweetness from the vanilla and coconut as well as Speedway Stout’s inherently rich, chocolaty character. Say aloha to something truly exceptional and evocative of its namesake isles.

The Nelson Sauvin hops shine and the alcohol is so unnoticeable that it too could be considered dangerously delicious.

        ""There’s no question that Stone Imperial Stout is revered among enthusiasts,"" states Stone CEO Greg Koch. ""I know, because I’m one of ’em and I can hardly wait for it to come out each year!""

Some may think that a late Spring release for a special brew of this sort is an odd time for it to come out onto the market. Koch justifies this with the rationalization ""What better than a warm time of year to come out with a brew that tastes great as it warms up!""

That’s because ""ice cold"" is certainly not the appropriate way to serve the beer. Nearly without exception, the darker, richer and more alcoholic a brew is, the warmer the serving temperature should be. The Stone Imperial Stout label describes the brew as being ""intensely aromatic (notes of anise, black currants, coffee, roastiness and alcohol) and heavy on the palate...expect this mysterious brew to pour like used motor oil and taste even heavier! Serve at 55 degrees.""

        For the past two years The Lost Abbey has released a winter barrel aged blended strong ale. This amazing blend of beer has focused on a marriage between Bourbon Barrel Aged Serpents Stout and Brandy Barrel Aged Angel’s Share. We believe it’s one of the most amazing barrel releases we do each fall.

But in the spirit of old recordings and records I started thinking what would happen if we played this one in reverse? Would we hear the Demon himself on the record? So with that, we flipped the blend on its ears and spun it backwards. The result is a blend of Brandy Barrel Aged Serpent’s Stout and some Bourbon Barrel Aged Angel’s Share.

The beer was a hit with our fans. When we wrote up the syllabus for the Ultimate Box Set, we knew a version of this beer would be included. We waited until the very end of the release schedule to put this beer in a bottle so that the coffee and cacoa nibs really come through. Four Bourbon barrels were selected for their rich and dense chocolate flavors. One week before packaging, we added 17 lbs of Ryan Brothers Coffee and 4 lbs of TCHO Cacao Nibs were added to the coffee and cacao to steep before packaging.

It was originally brewed by monks to provide themselves with a liquid form of nutrition during the fasting period of Lent when no solid food was allowed. This has earned the doppelbock the nickname ""liquid bread"" because of its rich and filling capacity. The Thomas Hooker Doppelbock Lager blends huge amounts of imported Munich, Vienna and Moravian malts with select dark roasted malts to achieve a malt lover’s dream of a rich and creamy brew. Subtly hopped with noble German and Czech hops and cool fermented with a Bavarian lager yeast, this beer will leave you happy to give up solid food for a while. No dessert necessary.

        The Thomas Hooker Imperial Porter is a full-bodied dark lager which draws its roots to the stronger porters of 19th Century England which would evolve into today’s stronger stouts. The porter derives tremendous complexity from the use of 8 different malts blended to balance sweet, caramel flavor with the coffeeish taste supplied by a judicious use of dark roasted malts. This brew is generously hopped with German and American hops that come to life as the beer is allowed to warm to its ideal temperature of 58-60 degrees. A great brew to add that holiday warmth and cheer to any beer lover’s winter. CHEERS.

Dogfish Head Bitches Brew,3.92,99,92,9%,270,"
        In honor of the 40th anniversary of the original release of Bitches Brew, Miles Davis’ 1970 paradigm-shifting landmark fusion breakthrough, we’ve created our own Bitches Brew - a bold, dark beer that’s a fusion of three threads imperial stout and one thread honey beer with gesho root, a gustatory analog to Miles’ masterpiece.Featuring the album’s iconic artwork, created by the late Mati Klarwein, on its label, Dogfish Head’s Bitches Brew will be unveiled at SAVOR, An American Craft Beer & Food Experience, June 5, National Building Museum, Washington DC.

Haven’t experienced the Bitches Brew album? Two 40th anniversary editions of Miles Davis’ Bitches Brew -- a Legacy Edition and a deluxe Collector’s Edition -- will be available Tuesday, August 31.

The newly created ale is designed, according to Dogfish founder and president Sam Calagione, ""as the ultimate partner for chili or spicy curry chicken"" and best enjoyed ""sipped cool, not cold, from a snifter or red wine glass while listening to the Bitches Brew album.""

Calagione was drawn to the alchemical spirits in Bitches Brew right out of college, acquiring a copy of the album ""within months of the first time I brewed a batch of homebrew in my apartment in New York City. I listened to it when I was writing my Dogfish business plan. I wanted Dogfish Head to be a maniacally inventive and creative brewery, analog beer for the digital age. You could say that my dream was to have Dogfish Head, in some small way, stand for the same thing in the beer world that Bitches Brew stands for in the jazz world. You can imagine how excited we are to be doing this project 17 years after I wrote that business plan.""

""There’s a spirit of innovation, of creativity and individuality, thats at the core of Miles’ music,"" said Adam Block, Senior Vice President and General Manager, Legacy Recordings. ""Sam and Dogfish Head approach their art from the same place and consequently the marriage is an easy and cool one.""

Dogfish Head and its ""off-centered ales for off-centered people"" were the subject of ""A Better Brew,"" an article in The New Yorker (Nov. 24, 2008) examining the rise of extreme beer. ""Beer has lagged well behind wine and organic produce in the ongoing reinvention of American cuisine. Yet the change over the past twenty years has been startling,"" wrote Burkhard Bilger. ""Dogfish is something of a mascot for this unruly movement. In the thirteen years since Calagione founded the brewery, it has gone from being the smallest in the country to the thirty-eighth largest. Calagione makes more beer with at least ten per cent alcohol than any other brewer, and his odd ingredients are often drawn from ancient or obscure beer traditions. It is to Budweiser what a bouillabaisse is to fish stock.""

Primary fermentation takes place in open vessels using two yeast strains, one American and one English. For added complexity, the beer is conditioned on barrel staves of French Oak for four months before being dry hopped with Glacier at the rate of a half-pound per barrel. This elixir is then blended 50/50 with 90 Minute IPA. After blending, the beer will measure 80 IBU and 10% abv.

        20 years ago when Sam was first cooking up ideas for brews (literally) for his soon to be brewpub, one of the first concoctions tested and implemented was Chicory Stout, a breakfast-themed beer with Mexican Coffee, Chicory, and Licorice root.  20 years later, we’ve brewed a supped up mac-daddy version of this OG Dogfish brew to commemorate the anniversary of Chicory, aptly named Beer for Breakfast. We took the original Chicory recipe, doubled the grain bill to hit 10% ABV, and tricked it out with all other sorts of delicious Breakfast-minded ingredients including lactose sugar (the sugar that lends Milk Stouts their character); barley malt smoked over local Fifer Orchards wood; maple syrup harvested from trees at Northfield Mount Hermon, the Western Massachusetts school where Sam and wife Mariah met; Steve’s Smokey Double Dark roast coffee from J & S Bean Factory in St. Paul Minnesota (a special nod to one of Sam’s favorite bands – The Replacements, who hail from Minnesota and wrote one of Sam’s most beloved songs: Beer for Breakfast); and for the quintessential Delaware breakfast touch – 25 pounds of Rapa Scrapple, which was added to the mash.  Huge notes of coffee in the nose give way to sweet, smokey, and savory layers in the flavor which overlap bittersweet chocolate, roasty espresso, and malty undertones.  We don’t have much of this one, so come and get it while it lasts!

Hive Plex Honey from California adds a subtle sweetness while maintaining the dry finish.The careful combination of all these ingredients creates a complex dark Belgian style ale with wonderful coffee and chocolate covered cherry flavors.

Hun Hunahpu, along with his brother Vucub Hunahpu, was tricked by the Dark Lords of the underworld and slain. Hun Hunahpu’s corpse morphed into a cacao tree, his head becoming a cacao pod, which in typically awesome mythology fashion, spit upon the hand of a young maiden named Xiquic who promptly became pregnant with the hero twins. The twins would ultimately grow up to avenge their father and uncle and defeat the Dark Lords and ascend the heavens to become the moon and sun.

Opaque black in color, the aroma has notes of espresso, chocolate, dark sweet toffee with hints of black strap molasses. The flavor starts with an unsweetened chocolate character and supporting notes of herbal dryness from English hop varietals. It then moves into dark toffee sweetness and closes with a slap of roasty espresso. Zhukov’s Imperial Stout pairs well with Mushroom Solyanka, dark chocolate, cherries and ground wars in Russia.

        Living large with his 7 year squeeze, Capt. Danky was suddenly blindsided as he discovered General Betrayus under the sheets with his ho. Unstable, delirious, and in desperate need of relief, he headed to the Cheetah to drown his sorrows with a few motorboats. After his wallet was drained by a lonely dental hygienist student, she whispered in his ear the 411 on a swinging late night dance club called Johnny’s Hideaway where he might get lucky. Wearing his big boy pants, he jumped in the first cab and beelined it to the hopeful honey hole. A stupefied Capt. Danky slipped in and was immediately pounced on by the house mama who set her meat hooks into him to do a little dirty dancing. Capt Danky was swept off his feet by this big ol’ beauty and lured back to her cougar den for some Danky Spanky. Capt Danky awoke with an ear to ear hicky and massive claw marks on his chest, back, and sack-a-jo-wia. He slowly rolled over and uncrusted his eyes, hoping to figure out what was saddled up next to him under the leopard skin sheets. As his vision cleared, he gagged, learning he had ‘seasoned” a big fat black double IPA. Horrified, he grabbed his ring off the nightstand and jumped out the window before it was awake and ready for roust two. Here’s to hoping his buddies never discover his bag-age. Get Some Strange!

        Double Vision Doppelbock was first brewed in 2009 to highlight our brewery’s wonderful water.  
Like all the great traditional brewing towns, our home, Victor, Idaho, is in or near some of the 
world’s best barley- and hop-growing regions, and is distinguished by an ample supply of top-
quality water.

Our Double Vision Doppelbock is brewed with Idaho 2-Row Pale and German Munich, Cara-
Aroma, CaraMunich and de-husked Carafa malts to an original gravity of 22˚ Plato.  The malts 
provide a dark leather color with ruby notes, a luxurious tan head, and a bready aroma with 
a hint of smoke.  It is lightly spiced with German Hallertau Tradition hops and fermented with 
lager yeast from a monastery brewery near Munich.  In the traditional manner, Double Vision 
is fermented cold (48˚F) and lagered a full 12 weeks for smoothness.  At 8.0% alcohol by 
volume, it is a deceptively drinkable springtime warmer.

The 17th century Paulist monks of Munich were allowed no solid food during their twice-yearly 
fasts.  They brewed an especially nourishing strong dark lager they called “liquid bread” and 
named “Holy Father” to help them through the Lenten and Advent fasts.  The beer was known 
as a doppelbock, which signifies a strong lager.  Since “bock” also means “billy goat” in German, 
these beers are often decorated with images of gallivanting goats.  

Double Vision’s slightly burnt caramel flavor and malt sweetness make it an incredible match 
for game—venison, moose, duck, goose, and wild boar—especially when prepared with fruity 
sauces or reductions.  Try it with pork and sautéed apples, roasted root vegetables, sweet 
sausages, ham or prosciutto.  It’s wonderful with cheese and dessert, too.  Pair it with an aged 
gruyère, a caramel flan, or a crème brûlée.

After the beer fermented to a low gravity resulting in a crisp, clean and dry beer, Grand Teton brewers transferred it to wine barrels where it aged for nine months. A few weeks before packaging, a blend of hops at a rate of 5 pounds per wooden barrel was added. The live Brett in this beer, as well as the generous amounts of unique and flavorful hops, makes this a great beer to drink fresh. It may also be cellared to further develop for years to come.

A really big batch of stout-so big the malt was coming out of the top of the mash tun.  After fermentation we brought in some bourbon barrels to age the stout.  One hundred and fifty days later, Bourbon County Stout was born-A liquid as dark and dense as a black hole with a thick foam the color of bourbon barrels.  The nose is a mix of charred oak, vanilla,carmel and smoke.  One sip has more flavor than your average case of beer.  It overpowers anything in the room.

        Traditionally, there are a lot of rules when it comes to brewing great beer. The fact that American craft brewers have broken those rules to produce some of the world’s finest beers is downright heroic. At Goose Island we live and die by hops, so breaking the rules meant pushing the hop limit to the extreme to create this monster Imperial IPA. We took three of our favorite hops, TETTNANG, SIMCOE, and CASCADE, and balanced their spiciness with tons of malt. Them we went back and dumped in MORE HOPS and more malt until this beer was exploding with flavor...strong enough to wake the dead and filled with more bitterness than a woman scorned. This Imperial IPA is absolutely gigantic, you’ll smell the hops from about a yard away. What will surprise you is how incredibly drinkable it is.

        This very special beer was brewed as a Double Strength Imperial Stout. Imperial Stouts being very big beers to begin with, that puts this at the strength of a barleywine. The Original Gravity is 27.5 P/1118, then the hopping level is very hard to define, though there are enough hops to achieve 100 IBUs in a smaller beer, this beer still has a distinct sweetness due to a high percentage of unfermentable sugars. After fermentation, this beer was aged in old whiskey barrels from the McCormack’s bottling plant in Weston, MO, hence the name Owd Mac’s (owd being a British regional colloquialism for old).

For the first incarnation, De Molen head brewer Menno Oliver hopped in a muscle car and drove straight through from the Netherlands to Louisville, KY (that’s USA folks) to brew this bourbon inspired ale, and we liked it so much, we decided to do it again.  We took the ingredients in bourbon whiskey (Barley, Rye, Corn) and then smoked them with cherry wood and brewed a huge imperial stout with them.  Then to top it off we aged it in Pappy VanWinkle Bourbon Barrels.  The resulting beer is rich, smokey and complex, with a bourbon character of caramel, vanilla and spice.

        A solid dose of light pilsner malt along with a variety of

crisp, clean base to work with. Then we got it All
Funked Up. Generous additions of Apollo and
Vanguard hops created a substantial flavor of citrus
peel and floral spice as well as plenty of IBUs for such
a mild malt bill. Ale yeast was then used for primary
fermentation before adding a blend of three strains of
Brettanomyces. These superattenuating little bugs
were allowed to thoroughly ferment out many complex
sugars and leave behind their characteristic (and very
apparent) wild and funky flavors. After about four and
a half months, we added a fresh addition of whole leaf
Amarillo hops that spent about a week imparting a
citrusy, almost candylike flavor. Finally, we moved the
beer to a bottle for a final fermentation that cleaned
and carbonated this beer to be ready for the glass.

While our bottle-conditioning process ensures this new Louisiana tradition will continue to evolve in the bottle, we like it best fresh.  Santé!

Abita Bourbon Street Barrel Aged Imperial Stout,3.64,95,48,10%,300,"
        Bourbon Street Stout is an Imperial Stout that is aged in Pappy Van Winkle Bourbon barrels. Our Imperial Stout is brewed with a combination of pale, caramel, chocolate and roasted malts. Oats are also added to give the beer a fuller and sweeter taste. The roasted malts give the beer its dark color as well as its intense flavor and aroma. After fermentation the beer is cold aged for 6 weeks. This is necessary for all of the flavors of the malt and hops to balance and produce a very smooth flavor.

After the cold aging the beer is transferred into the bourbon barrels. It is then aged for another 8 weeks to absorb all of the flavors from the barrels. The result is a strong stout that brings out the roasted flavors from the malt and the warming toasted, vanilla, and bourbon flavors from the barrels.

The sweetness of the lactose helps balance the bitterness of the brew just like in the coffee drink, which is our inspiration. The roasted malts give the beer its dark color as well as its intense flavor and aroma. Willamette hops are added to balance out the sweetness of the malts. Finally, PJ’s Coffee espresso dolce beans are added to the aging tank. This gives the beer a strong coffee flavor and aroma that compliments the existing flavors of the malt.

I compiled some of my favorite attributes into a format that would be pleasing on any day or time. Low abv, dry finish with a light funky yeast esters that are accented with a abundance of earthy & fruity hops. Balance is always the goal, but for this I also wanted extreme quaff-ability, refreshment, and subtle complexity.. Classic? perhaps. www.tablebeer.com

Tree House Good Morning,4.16,100,99,8.4%,252,"
        A project that began as Imperial Double Shot has matured into a distinct beer that is perhaps our most complex yet!  Brewed with Monson’s own Maxwell Road Maple Grade A Dark Amber Maple syrup, Good Morning pours pitch black in the glass with a creamy mousse-like head.  The bubbles give way to aromas of rich milk chocolate, cocoa powder, and dark amber maple syrup. The flavor starts as a blast of milk chocolate and sweet maple syrup, as deeper complexities are uncovered as it warms.  The crew here at Tree House tastes “chocolate covered maple candy”, “vanilla”, “chocolate cake”, “brown sugar”, and “fresh roasted coffee”.  A super decadent treat, Good Morning begs to be shared and contemplated!

Tree House Alter Ego,4.11,100,100,6.8%,204,"
        What we did here is we took a whole bunch of Mosaic and Amarillo hops, a classic punch of citrus purveying goodness, and added them to the Julius dry hop. The base beer is exactly the same, but the dry hop is altered tremendously.  The result is a beer with all the deliciousness of the base with a pungent additional layer of citrusy complexity.  Soft velvety hop juice -  we call it Devil Julius. A real treat!

        To create Utopias, the brewers at Sam Adams used traditional brewing ingredients including all four types of Noble hops, which add a slightly earthy, herbal taste. The spiciness of the hops really comes alive. In fact, Utopias MMII has even been described by some as almost ""fiery"" -- a fitting description for the strongest beer in history. Beyond the special brand of hops, Utopias features ingredients that truly set it apart from other varieties of beer. Utopias MMII contains caramel and Vienna malts for its rich amber color and several different types of yeast including a variety found in champagne. $100 a bottle and it's limited to 3000 bottles, which look like copper brew kettles.

On the eve of our first anniversary, I brewed another beer for Lauren, In Perpetuity.  It hopes to celebrate foreverness - in love, passion, and regardless of circumstance - the notion that what is good and beloved will last forever.  In Perpetuity is brewed with a simple malt bill and two of my favorite hops - Citra, and Nelson.  It pours a hazy bright orange in the glass and mixes notes of tropical fruit with a strong citrus backbone.  Soft, and eminently drinkable.  I hope you enjoy it.

Without Golden Promise malt, made by family-owned Simpsons Malt, Furious would just be pissed offed. From Scotland, this malt is still produced in the tradition of turning over the barley by hand, resulting in a malt that is unsurpassed in its quality. Golden Promise is also used extensively by premium whisky distilleries such as The Macallan. This malt provides the backbone for the intense hop character. Four American hop varieties are used at a rate of over three pounds per barrel. The result is a rich malt sweetness infused with bright hop flavor and aroma from beginning to end.

Big Sky Shake-A-Day India Pale Ale,3.5,88,79,7.5%,225,"
        This beer is Big Sky’s interpretation of an American IPA (BJCP 21A).  It’s a hoppy, bitter, strong pale ale showcasing some of our favorite hop varieties.  The balance of this beer is definitely hop-forward with just enough malt to support the aggressive hopping rates.  We used Simcoe, Cascade and Galaxy hops throughout the process at a rate of 3lb/bbl imparting aromas of citrus, pine and tropical fruit.  The base is a combination of Pale 2-row and light Munich malt for a subtle grainy-malt flavor with a clean, dry finish.  Fermented with an American yeast strain, this beer was a true departure from our regular brand portfolio.

Montana Brewing Custers Last Stout,3.5,88,87,5.5%,165,"
        Custer’s Last Stout is a Foreign-Style stout. It has an initial malt sweetness and chocolate flavor with a dry roasted bitterness finish. It is brewed with English malted barley and domestic Fuggle hops. This variety of hop adds a slight herbal (licorice) aroma and flavor to our stout.

Foreign-Style stouts originated when English breweries added more hops and alcohol to their classic dry stouts as a natural preservative. They did this so the beer would survive the long journey to their far reaching empire around the world.

Chicago Hardway IPA,3.46,85,72,6.2%,186,"
        The history of India pale ales date back to the 18th century when British troops occupied India. Beer was made in England and sent to the stationed troops. Pale ales were popular beers at the time and had to endure a six month journey to the distant country. Spoilage was common and one way to prevent the loss of beer was to add more hops to the existing recipe, which are an excellent natural preservative. The addition of more hops made pale ales stronger with a higher alcohol content. Basically, India Pale Ales are stronger over hopped versions of it's cousin, the Pale Ale. The style has grown very popular in this country over the years and can be found all around. Our IPA is more aggressive than most with a high hop aroma. The taste is a true hop bomb. The IPA appears somewhat cloudy because it is unfiltered, leaving every bit of flavor in the glass.

Carton Shipwreck Porter,3.85,99,93,10%,300,"
        When our friends and neighbors at Brinley shipped us ten of the barrels used to make their Brinley Gold Shipwreck Rum from their distillery on St. Kitts, we were given the opportunity to create a beer that would take advantage of wood rather than the other way around. We looked to coax complexity out of the marriage of a barrel’s soul and a brew’s potential, not just to bomb a huge beer with huge flavor. The rum that lives in these barrels for four years integrates its spice to the wood so well that it ends up reminiscent of a Bananas Foster. A sturdy brown honey porter seemed the best host to receive the ghosts from Shipwreck’s old home. We started with a base of deep malts looking for notes of coffee and chocolate, then enhanced them with the floral bouquet of local wildflower honey and the preservative strength of 10% ABV while keeping the body sensible. This was put in the casks to meld with the vanilla, wood, and spice notes, toned down by the oxidative effect of a year in the cellar. Drink Shipwreck Porter because a barrel should be so much more than a depth charge.

Triumph Rauchweizen,3.8,99,100,5%,150,"
        In the Bavarian town of Bamberg they still kiln their malt over beechwood fires. The malt absorbs the flavor of  woodsmoke and imparts it, in turn, to  the beer.  Even when brewing hefeweizen the barley malt portion of the grist is smoked, yielding a beer that combines that smokiness with the  clove and banana flavors of hefeweizen.

Kane Head High,3.85,99,99,6.5%,195,"
        Head High is our interpretation of an American-style India Pale Ale (IPA).  This beer is all about the hops; we use a blend of five different varieties all grown in the Pacific Northwest.  A small charge of Chinook and Columbus early in the boil adds a smooth bitterness.  A majority of the hops are then added late in the kettle or post-fermentation to produce a beer that is heavy on hop flavor and aroma.  The combination of Cascade, Centennial, Citra and Columbus give Head High a noticeable grapefruit flavor with aromas of citrus, tropical fruits and pine.  Our house American ale yeast ferments to a dry finish that accentuates the use of imported Pilsner and lightly kilned crystal malt resulting in Head High’s straw color and crisp flavor.",80,DNE

Kane A Night to End All Dawns,3.82,99,83,12.6%,378,"
        A Night To End All Dawns began life as an imperial stout and was transformed into a massive dark ale during 15 months spent in bourbon barrels. The extended aging allowed seasonal temperature fluctuations in the barrels to draw bold flavors from the oak that can only develop with time. The heat of the bourbon gave way to a subtle caramel sweetness, and the bold, sharp edges of the roasted malt mellowed and married with notes of vanilla and oak. Belgian Candi Sugar in the kettle created a layer of dark fruit complexity and a dry finish.

With Dune Fruit we add the meat of prickly pear paddles to a simply soured wheat beer to draw out their subtle vegetable sweetness and cut their viscidity with some acid. A delicate balance of vegetal and brightness in the form of an unassuming sour. Drink Dune Fruit because it’s the top of the summer and it’s time to shift that palate back to the sand.

It’s bittered with a gigantic charge of Columbus and Simcoe early in the kettle that is followed by several rounds of late kettle and whirlpool hops using Amarillo, Centennial and Simoce.  In the end, Overhead is brewed with over 5 pounds of hops per barrel which includes two rounds of dry hopping to create a cascade of pine, resin and citrus hop flavors that consume your palate.

        This beer sat quietly, aging in our barrel room for over a year before we decided it was time - time to blend in some beautiful ripe red grapes, Brettanomyces, freshly emptied wine barrels and time, this beer is infinitely complex and a challenge to the perception of what beer can be. This beer is re-fermented in the bottle and will age for years to come. Straight from the Captain’s cellar to yours, we hope you enjoy.

Southern Tier Imperial Oat,3.98,100,95,11%,330,"
        “brewed for the harvest”
This beer begins in spring when oat seeds are sown as soon as the
soil can be worked. Meanwhile, select types of barley are planted with
hopes that Mother Nature will be kind. Our brewers wait patiently until
the legumes are mature and ready for the scythe. Upon delivery to the
brewery, these ingredients are mixed together in the mash tun where
they steep, creating a rich molasses-like liquid. Spicy hops are boiled
with the thick brew, giving balance and complexity. Brewers yeast feasts
upon the rich sugars, concluding its transformation into oatmeal stout.
Pour Oat into a snifter, allow its thick tan head to slowly rise, releasing
unbridled aromas. The color of Oat is as dark as a moonless night. The
first sip reveals Oat’s thick and nourishing taste. Like a haversack to a
horse, a bottle of this stout is a meal in itself. Enjoy responsibly.

Jackie O’s Bourbon Barrel Dark Apparition,3.99,100,95,10.5%,315,"
        This hauntingly good brew in your hand is rife with dark complexities. Eleven malts were used to create deep flavors of coffee, chocolate, caramel, and molasses. A hint of bitterness and herbal character from carefully selected American hops help support the monolithic maltiness of Dark Apparition. After a month of conditioning in stainless steel, the beer was transferred into bourbon barrels. For 8 months, Dark Apparition waited patiently in oak barrels until the time was right to spring forth with its ghostly gusto. A truly decadent brew that is intended to be poured into your favorite snifter and given time to warm up from its dark and cold resting place. Be aware when in the presence of Dark Apparition ’cause this ghost is a creeper.

        Around the brewery, we listen to a lot of reggae, drink a fair share of coffee, and our devoted to our barrel aging program. There was a one-off imperial stout that had been resting in bourbon barrels for 11 months; these barrels had a strong dark chocolate presence but needed a boost. Green Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee beans made their way to Athens, OH - Stauf’s Coffee Roasters nailed the perfect roast to complement the barrel-aged stout. Champion Ground was born! A culmination of exploration and many guilty pleasures. The illustration on the label is of Charlie Ace’s Swing-A-Ling Mobile Record Shack, which was notorious for broadcasting the ""Champion Sound!""

Newport Storm Cyclone Series Vlad,3.49,,,9%,270,"
        Brewing this Cyclone wasn’t as easy as previous ones; it took round-the-clock brewing and three “maxed mash tuns” to deliver the high extract/sugar content which would translate into Vlad’s hefty ~ 9% ABV.  Further, extra tank conditioning time was required to create the smoothness.
All of the additional production effort is easily rewarded for those who love stouts specializing in dark roasted and chocolate flavors.  Over 15% of this finished brew was created by a confluence of darker specialty grains chosen to be just under the “whoa, that is an intense flavor” threshold.  Vlad drinks remarkably balanced given the higher alcohol and dark malt additions with flavors of rounded baker’s chocolate and dark roasted coffee.  We also used a new ingredient to us: chocolate wheat, to help create the lasting thick tan foam head that invites you to the next warming sip out of your favorite tasting glass. 
Warrior hops were chosen as the sole hop in this brew and were only added to create a rounded bitterness to compliment all that dark malty sweetness.  The emphasis with this brew are the waves of chocolate, roasted, cherry, coffee, and finishing roasted flavors that will almost pleasingly overwhelm you.

With more than 100 years of shared heritage, the two local legends joined forces to celebrate the art of craft brewing and bring New England an emblematic brew that pays homage to their history. The full-bodied milk stout is enriched with the robust flavor of Autocrat Coffee to achieve an extraordinary taste experience. Brewed under the supervision of award-winning Brewmaster Sean Larkin, Narragansett’s Autocrat Coffee Milk Stout delivers a flavorful, smooth, dark brew with notes of roasted barley, chocolate malt and rich crystal malt. The exacting touch of hops provides just the right amount of bitterness to balance the sweet notes of the malts and milk sugar.

Newport Storm Cyclone Series Zach,3.35,82,22,10.1%,303,"
        In 2006, the Coastal Extreme Brewing Crew started the Cyclone Series, a clever idea before limited release beers were the norm. This clever idea produced 26 different beers ranging widely in taste, complexity, and lack of sleep for our brewers! We traveled through the alphabet, with no shortcuts, starting with Alyssa and now introducing, the last letter ‘Z’ for Zach, an imperial oatmeal stout.

Cyclone Zach is an intense beer, both in its brewing and flavor profile. Six mashes, rather than the usual two, were required to create this brew, leading to round the clock brewing. Boasting a 10.1% ABV Zach is truly a big and bold beer, but his most important characteristic is smoothness. To create Zach’s silky smooth flavor, the brewers combined extra tank conditioning time with the addition of the most flaked oat ever used in a Storm brew, to balance the otherwise over intense roasted backbone of the beer. This Cyclone will stand up to the test of time, our Brew Master recommends aging this beer for years to come.

Not quite an Imperial IPA, but definitely on the large side, Tendril weighs in around 7.8% abv and 80 IBU. This beer has been dubbed Proclamation Ale Company’s “1 and ½ times IPA.” Showcasing a few of the famous “C” hops as well as a few lesser known, often overlooked “bastard-stepchildren” hops, this IPA delivers a dry finish that will leave your tongue coated with fruity, piney, citrusy, dankity-yumyumness. A restrained specialty malt bill, with very light additions of English crystal malt give the beer enough body to hold up the hops, but still lets the greenness punch you square in the teeth.

The aroma is dominated by fruity esters reminiscent of citrus fruits along with a moderate earthy and floral hop aroma from the use of Noble-type hops in the brewing process. Has a deep gold, hue that is often hazy, and a voluminous head on pouring as a result of the bottle-conditioning and high natural carbonation. The beer is medium-bodied and has a very refreshing effervescence which, along with a fairly low alcohol content, makes this a beer to be enjoyed on a warm day by itself or with a wide range of foods, whether casual or fine dining. Complex flavors and aromas in this beer are a result of the special yeast used in fermentation combined with the additional complexity added by bottle-conditioning in large bottles for at least six weeks before being released.

Jester King Sherry Barrel Atrial Rubicite,4.16,100,100,7%,210,"
        A lot of time went into making this beer. This isn’t to suggest that very long periods of maturation in oak automatically lead to good beer. Far from it. In fact, some of our favorite beers we’ve made have achieved some really nice characteristics in just a few months. However, we’re really pleased with the way Sherry Barrel Atrial Rubicite turned out and are happy it received all the time it did.

The base beer for Sherry Barrel Atrial Rubicite was brewed in 2013. After maturing in oak barrels for about a year, it was blended during the spring of 2014 and refermented with raspberries. It was then racked to a single 500 liter Spanish sherry barrel for further aging and maturation. In July of 2015, fifteen months later, we racked the beer out of the sherry barrel and bottled it. All together, Sherry Barrel Atrial Rubicite took a little over two years to make. Again, this isn’t to suggest that long periods of fermentation and maturation necessarily equate to enjoyable beer, but in this case, we think it does.

Sherry Barrel Atrial Rubicite was brewed with Hill Country well water, barley, wheat, oats, and hops. It was fermented with our mixed culture of microorganisms consisting of brewers yeast and native yeast and bacteria harvested from the air and wildflowers around our brewery, and refermented with raspberries grown in Washington. Sherry Barrel Atrial Rubicite was pakagd in July of 2015 and is unfiltered, unpasteurized, and 100% naturally conditioned. At the time of bottling, it was 7.0% alcohol by volume, 1.003 specific gravity (0.75 degrees Plato), 7 IBU, and 3.3 pH.

        We’re pleased to introduce Jester King Bière de Blanc du Bois — a barrel aged, sour beer refermented with Texas-grown Blanc du Bois grapes. Bière de Blanc du Bois is the creation of Adrienne Ballou, Head of the Barrel Program at Jester King. Adrienne came to us about two years ago, having previously studied viticulture at U.C. Davis and worked in the wine industry in France. During her time at Jester King, she has implemented numerous wine making techniques into our fermentations, including our use of punch downs during our fruit refermentations. Punch downs lead to better flavor and color extraction from the fruit during refermentation and aid in keeping acetic acid development (think vinegar) at bay. Bière de Blanc du Bois is one of the special projects that Adrienne has worked on over the last several months. Here is her description of the inspiration, process, and presentation:

We then allowed the beer to slowly referment the peaches to dryness, resulting in a unique beer that reflects our setting in the Texas Hill Country.",DNE,DNE
Jester King Bière de Syrah,3.87,99,96,7.3%,219,"
        We are pleased to introduce Jester King Bière de Syrah — a barrel-aged sour beer refermented with Syrah grapes. Bière de Syrah consists of a blend of beer fermented in oak barrels for nine to twelve months with our mixed culture of brewers yeast and native yeast and bacteria harvested from the air and wildflowers around our brewery. The blend was then refermented with Syrah grapes for about two weeks, transferred off of the fruit, then aged for an additional nine months in oak barrels. After packaging, the beer naturally conditioned for an additional two months prior to release. Altogether, Bière de Syrah is roughly two years old.

Bière de Syrah spent considerably more time aging than most of our other fruited sour beers. This is due to the fact that our Barrel Program Head Adrienne Ballou likes the practice of racking (transferring) beer refermented with wine grapes back into oak barrels for further maturation. Adrienne came to Jester King from the wine world and brought several winemaking techniques with her. According to Adrienne, maturation in oak barrels following fruit refermentation allows the beer to take on more complex characteristics than just bright fruit character and acidity.

The grapes used in the refermentation of Bière de Syrah came from the 2014 harvest in California. We attempt to use native Texas fruit whenever possible, but in this case, we had difficultly sourcing Texas grapes last year. Most of the grapes from the 2014 Texas harvest went to winemakers. Fortunately, we’ve developed some great relationships with wineries in our area, so hopefully this will be the last time we source grapes from California, or anywhere outside of Texas.

Bière de Syrah was brewed with Hill Country well water, barley, wheat, oats, and hops. It was fermented with our mixed culture of brewers yeast and native yeast and bacteria harvested from the Texas Hill Country prior to refermentation with Syrah grapes. It is unfiltered, unpasteurized, and 100% naturally conditioned in bottles, kegs, and casks. Bière de Syrah is 7.3% alcohol by volume, 9 IBU, 3.2 pH at the time of packaging in June 2015, and has a finishing gravity of 1.001 (0.25 degrees Plato).

        Epic Brewing Company’s latest barrel-aged beer brings something new—wild yeast. This brew is a collaboration ale with Crooked Stave Artisan Brewing of Fort Collins, Colorado.  Chad Yakobson, Brewmaster/Owner of Crooked Stave, is well known for his skill and knowledge in the brewing of sour and Brettanomyces driven beers.  The beer was brewed at Epic by the two brewers. Kevin Crompton, Epic’s Brewmaster, and Chad spent several weeks working on the recipe and selecting the proper Brett strains and barrels for the beer to morph from a golden Saison into a Saison-Brett Golden Ale.

Red Rock Paardebloem ,3.7,97,96,8.8%,264,"
        This strong Belgian style ale is made with hand-toasted Pilsner malt, grains of paradise, and fresh picked dandelion greens. Although dandelions are considered a nuisance weed around the world, dandelion greens are a natural toxin-remover, and show up throughout modern history in various tonics and folk remedies. Paardebloem (Flemish for dandelion) has a hazy, deep golden color, a soft-toasted malt character and is 100% bottle conditioned. The grain bill was designed to produce a malty, light bodied beer, emphasizing the flavors of the spices and esters of the Belgian yeast strain.
Paardebloem (Flemish for dandelion) was created in conjunction with Chris McCombs and New Belgium Brewing Company. 9.2% alcohol by volume.

Epic Smoked & Oaked Belgian-Style Ale,3.67,96,95,9.5%,285,"
        This is a Belgian-style strong ale but with an American fusion twist dreamt up by Epic. Using authentic Belgian-style yeast, this is a malt-driven beer with Maris Otter malt as a base and a hint of Pilsner malt. For the first twist we use smoked cherry wood malt that works it’s magic, bringing a smoky sweetness to the caramel malts and a bit of peat flavor as well. This ale then really marries together when it hits the cask. The entire batch aging in the whiskey barrels nicely dries out the perceived sweetness of the caramel malt leaving an almost scotch like taste, with smoke, bourbon, hints of vanilla, wood, aged fruit from the Belgian yeast and some peat. A very, very special extremely flavorful strong ale made for sharing.

DC Brau and Epic, both honored with invitations to SAVOR(SM), will be serving this beer in Washington DC as a celebratory beverage during the craft beer and food event in June. We brewed our award winning Brainless® Belgian Golden Ale and let DC Brau corrupt it with four types of hops, including the fruity Citra in the dry hop. Brainless®: Corruption starts out with a wonderful aroma of pineapple, hops and tart fruit. On first sip you taste that familiar cotton-candy and bubble gum sweetness of Brainless® that quickly gives way to a hoppy storm of tropical fruit and tart citrus that lingers on the tongue.
Note: the only way to identify this beer is near the ABV marking where is says Corruption.

        MALTS: 2-row, C-60

ADJUNCTS: 60 lbs of Local Wildflower Honey from Burnside Farms

HOPS: Hop Union Experimental Variety, Mosaic, Simcoe, Cascade

ABV: 8.5%

BACK STORY:

Here at DC Brau we love our hoppy beers. This is our latest attempt in seeing how many hops we can fit into a DIPA and I think we’ve hit a new mark. This beer clocks in around 100 IBU, similar to OTWOA but uses 4 different varieties instead of 1. Alpha-Domina-Mellis was also brewed with 30 lbs of Wildflower honey from Burnside Farms in Haymarket, VA that was added at the end of the 90 min boil and then 30 lbs added directly into the fermenter on the second day of primary fermentation.

TASTING NOTES:

Alpha-Domina-Mellis leads in with a peach-like color and a distinctive tropical / pineapple like nose with a hint of breadiness. Mouthfeel is light and crisp with a huge, lingering bitterness provided by the huge dose of experimental hops that were added early in the boil. What the drinker is left with is a bitterness that won’t quit followed by a heavy tropical, fruity, ""juicy fruit"" bubblegum like aroma with a lingering aroma reminiscent of star fruit and stone fruit.

        DC Brau Brewing Company is happy to announce the release of ""For Others,"" a limited-release Double IPA brewed to celebrate the nuptials of two of its own: DC Brau webmaster and packaging designer Rob Shortley and his long-time partner in crime, Celia Wells.

""For Others"" was brewed according to one of Shortley’s homebrew recipes that DC Brau head brewer and president Jeff Hancock reworked for a commercial batch size. ""We wanted to do something special for Rob,"" said DC Brau CEO Brandon Skall. ""He’s been helping out the brewery for a really long time. He’s a part of the Brau family. That said, we definitely made him work for it."" On the day of brewing, Shortley showed up bright and early and started hauling sacks of grain. Afterward, Skall had him clean out the 1,200 pounds of spent grain that went into the brew.

The name “For Others” is a nod to Shortley’s alma mater, Gonzaga College High School, the motto of which is ""Men for Others.” The private academy has been a Washington, DC fixture since 1821.

Though the beer was brewed specifically for the Shortley wedding, DC Brau will be also be distributing “For Others” city-wide, as well as to Virginia, starting October 14th. ""I think we put a new spin on an old adage,"" said Skall. ""Something old, something new, something borrowed, and something brewed.""

""For Others"" is an intense, all-Citra hopped, double IPA - weighing in at around 8.2% ABV. Available from the brewery in growlers-only or on-draft from bars and restaurants.

All of the flavors and aromas of a highly hopped beer are balanced with a combination of several quality barley malts to prove a surprisingly drinkable 7.47% ABV beer.  At BBW we believe that an IPA should have a good malt character to sing along with the abundance of bittering and flavor hops used.  This beer is unfiltered and unpasteurized and is partially bottle conditioned therefore it may have a small amount of yeast sediment on the bottom of the bottle.  We suggest letting this beer warm up slightly from refrigeration temperature then pour into 2 clean clear pint glasses roughing the beer up a bit (pour aggressively) at the end of each pour to bring up a nice thick head.  You may reserve any sediment and dispose or drink it - please don’t be afraid of sediment!  It is the result of living yeast and is yummy.   We hope you enjoy this beer as much as we do and share it responsibly with friends.

        Dear (insert your name here), This is the best damn DIPA in the world. So if you were even considering sulking today, think again.

So close your eyes, open up, and experience the mad floral, citrusy, and clean taste of hop talent. If you don’t love it, no...... you will.

Melvin Asterisk Double IPA,3.81,98,95,9.5%,285,"
        Take an India Pale Ale and feed it steroids, ergo the term Double IPA. Although open to the same interpretation as its sister styles, you should expect something robust, malty, alcoholic and with a hop profile that might rip your tongue out. The Imperial usage comes from Russian Imperial stout, a style of strong stout originally brewed in England for the Russian Imperial Court of the late 1700s; though Double IPA is often the preferred name. 

You can thank west coast American brewers for this somewhat reactionary style. ""Thanks!""
