""For Others"" was brewed according to one of Shortley’s homebrew recipes that DC Brau head brewer and president Jeff Hancock reworked for a commercial batch size. ""We wanted to do something special for Rob,"" said DC Brau CEO Brandon Skall. ""He’s been helping out the brewery for a really long time. He’s a part of the Brau family. That said, we definitely made him work for it."" On the day of brewing, Shortley showed up bright and early and started hauling sacks of grain. Afterward, Skall had him clean out the 1,200 pounds of spent grain that went into the brew.

The name “For Others” is a nod to Shortley’s alma mater, Gonzaga College High School, the motto of which is ""Men for Others.” The private academy has been a Washington, DC fixture since 1821.

Though the beer was brewed specifically for the Shortley wedding, DC Brau will be also be distributing “For Others” city-wide, as well as to Virginia, starting October 14th. ""I think we put a new spin on an old adage,"" said Skall. ""Something old, something new, something borrowed, and something brewed.""

""For Others"" is an intense, all-Citra hopped, double IPA - weighing in at around 8.2% ABV. Available from the brewery in growlers-only or on-draft from bars and restaurants."

At BBW we believe that an IPA should have a good malt character to sing along with the abundance of bittering and flavor hops used.  This beer is unfiltered and unpasteurized and is partially bottle conditioned therefore it may have a small amount of yeast sediment on the bottom of the bottle.  We suggest letting this beer warm up slightly from refrigeration temperature then pour into 2 clean clear pint glasses roughing the beer up a bit (pour aggressively) at the end of each pour to bring up a nice thick head.  You may reserve any sediment and dispose or drink it - please don’t be afraid of sediment!  It is the result of living yeast and is yummy.

ADJUNCTS: 60 lbs of Local Wildflower Honey from Burnside Farms

HOPS: Hop Union Experimental Variety, Mosaic, Simcoe, Cascade

ABV: 8.5%

BACK STORY:

Here at DC Brau we love our hoppy beers. This is our latest attempt in seeing how many hops we can fit into a DIPA and I think we’ve hit a new mark. This beer clocks in around 100 IBU, similar to OTWOA but uses 4 different varieties instead of 1. Alpha-Domina-Mellis was also brewed with 30 lbs of Wildflower honey from Burnside Farms in Haymarket, VA that was added at the end of the 90 min boil and then 30 lbs added directly into the fermenter on the second day of primary fermentation.

TASTING NOTES:

Alpha-Domina-Mellis leads in with a peach-like color and a distinctive tropical / pineapple like nose with a hint of breadiness. Mouthfeel is light and crisp with a huge, lingering bitterness provided by the huge dose of experimental hops that were added early in the boil. What the drinker is left with is a bitterness that won’t quit followed by a heavy tropical, fruity, ""juicy fruit"" bubblegum like aroma with a lingering aroma reminiscent of star fruit and stone fruit."

Our eyes widened at the possibilities, it was like a new frontier of flavor had been opened up. 

Green coffee beans are like sponges, they soak up the aromas and flavors of their environment. If you put them in a used whiskey barrel, you’ll get notes of toffee, vanilla, oak, and campfire alongside the beans natural fruity and roasted flavors. The barrel aged coffees coming from HotBox are some of the most exciting and truly unique coffees we’ve tasted. We selected their single origin Ethopian Yirgacheffe for its bright blueberry and pomegranate flavors. It’s a major departure from the classic Columbian and Central American flavor profile we normally select for Big Bad Baptist but with the additional flavor contribution from the whiskey barrel and Hot Box’s carful roasting, the coffee comes to the forefront of the beer and really showcases the unique process.

To accommodate the bold flavors of the coffee we sourced equally creative and maliciously crafted cacao nibs from Solstice Chocolate. Solstice Chocolate is a small artisan chocolate maker based out of Salt Lake City. They specialize in sourcing exotic, organically grown cacao from around the world. Each single origin cacao is roasted in house to bring out its inherent characteristics.

Bière de Syrah consists of a blend of beer fermented in oak barrels for nine to twelve months with our mixed culture of brewers yeast and native yeast and bacteria harvested from the air and wildflowers around our brewery. The blend was then refermented with Syrah grapes for about two weeks, transferred off of the fruit, then aged for an additional nine months in oak barrels. After packaging, the beer naturally conditioned for an additional two months prior to release. Altogether, Bière de Syrah is roughly two years old.

Bière de Syrah spent considerably more time aging than most of our other fruited sour beers. This is due to the fact that our Barrel Program Head Adrienne Ballou likes the practice of racking (transferring) beer refermented with wine grapes back into oak barrels for further maturation. Adrienne came to Jester King from the wine world and brought several winemaking techniques with her. According to Adrienne, maturation in oak barrels following fruit refermentation allows the beer to take on more complex characteristics than just bright fruit character and acidity.

The grapes used in the refermentation of Bière de Syrah came from the 2014 harvest in California. We attempt to use native Texas fruit whenever possible, but in this case, we had difficultly sourcing Texas grapes last year. Most of the grapes from the 2014 Texas harvest went to winemakers. Fortunately, we’ve developed some great relationships with wineries in our area, so hopefully this will be the last time we source grapes from California, or anywhere outside of Texas.

Bière de Syrah was brewed with Hill Country well water, barley, wheat, oats, and hops. It was fermented with our mixed culture of brewers yeast and native yeast and bacteria harvested from the Texas Hill Country prior to refermentation with Syrah grapes. It is unfiltered, unpasteurized, and 100% naturally conditioned in bottles, kegs, and casks. Bière de Syrah is 7.3% alcohol by volume, 9 IBU, 3.2 pH at the time of packaging in June 2015, and has a finishing gravity of 1.001 (0.25 degrees Plato)."

Davis and worked in the wine industry in France. During her time at Jester King, she has implemented numerous wine making techniques into our fermentations, including our use of punch downs during our fruit refermentations. Punch downs lead to better flavor and color extraction from the fruit during refermentation and aid in keeping acetic acid development (think vinegar) at bay. Bière de Blanc du Bois is one of the special projects that Adrienne has worked on over the last several months. Here is her description of the inspiration, process, and presentation:"

In fact, some of our favorite beers we’ve made have achieved some really nice characteristics in just a few months. However, we’re really pleased with the way Sherry Barrel Atrial Rubicite turned out and are happy it received all the time it did.

The base beer for Sherry Barrel Atrial Rubicite was brewed in 2013. After maturing in oak barrels for about a year, it was blended during the spring of 2014 and refermented with raspberries. It was then racked to a single 500 liter Spanish sherry barrel for further aging and maturation. In July of 2015, fifteen months later, we racked the beer out of the sherry barrel and bottled it. All together, Sherry Barrel Atrial Rubicite took a little over two years to make. Again, this isn’t to suggest that long periods of fermentation and maturation necessarily equate to enjoyable beer, but in this case, we think it does.

Sherry Barrel Atrial Rubicite was brewed with Hill Country well water, barley, wheat, oats, and hops. It was fermented with our mixed culture of microorganisms consisting of brewers yeast and native yeast and bacteria harvested from the air and wildflowers around our brewery, and refermented with raspberries grown in Washington. Sherry Barrel Atrial Rubicite was pakagd in July of 2015 and is unfiltered, unpasteurized, and 100% naturally conditioned. At the time of bottling, it was 7.0% alcohol by volume, 1.003 specific gravity (0.75 degrees Plato), 7 IBU, and 3.3 pH.
