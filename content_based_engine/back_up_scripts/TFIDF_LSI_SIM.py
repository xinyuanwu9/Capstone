    text.append('Approximately 4 oz. from a 12 oz. can, consumed on 6-7-16. Pours a mostly clear but slightly hazy dull copper to dark amber with a small to moderate amount of beige head. Juicy, fruity, toffee aroma. Scents of apricot, watermelon, and melon-flavored gum. Way too fruity in aroma for my preferences. Milky, cardboard, plastic, off flavor. Drier than the aroma implies. Theres an astringency that is unpleasant. Awful at first but settles in to being merely very bad. Definitely flawed. Medium body. Reasonably lively. Forgettable palate effects. One of the worst bottled or canned beers Ive ever had. Id take a typical, boring, flavor-free, macro American pale lager over this any day')
    text.append('3.4 Minnesota Trip Beer #157. 12 ounce can from North Loop Spirits, 5/11/16. Hazy dark copper, large foamy tan head, good retention. Aroma of piney, tropical hops and caramel. The taste is toffee, caramel, leafy and piney hops. Thin. Nice aroma, kinda falls a little flat after that. A good start at least.  |1.6|3.4|3.5|2.9|3.7')
    text.append('Throw in from a trade with GreatDane 1632...Pours a golden amber color with big fluffy head. Aromas of sweet malts, hops, and some fruity notes. Flavor is hoppy malty with a nice dry finish')
    text.append('Dark amber/cider color; Medium creamy body; Aroma of toasted malt, caramel, hops, & some fruit; Flavor of sweet malt, toffee, caramel, and spicy hops; Finish is slightly bitter; Good')
    text.append('The aroma has much malt, and as I sip, I taste the herbal, vegetal hops. Taste is normal; not too sweet, not too bitter, not sour at all. The body is medium, with some soft carbonation. Overall, even though this beer has some good qualities, I didnt have much reaction to it')
    text.append('Tap at the taproom. Somewhat hazy reddish orange pour with a spotty white head. Citrusy aroma with a sweet malt and citrus taste. Crisp on the tongue. Good stuff')
