Bitter Monk Belgian Double IPA is such a beer. Redolent of citrusy hop bittering and massive malt infusion, this is a beer to ponder, to sip, and, even for a monk, to dream. Why then is the monk so bitter? What provokes that sly smile? What is he wearing under that flowing robe? A triple-fermented beer gives him three times the mystery. Remember, anything worth doing is worth over doing. Nothing exceeds like excess. Even for the cloistered.

That's because ""ice cold"" is certainly not the appropriate way to serve the beer. Nearly without exception, the darker, richer and more alcoholic a brew is, the warmer the serving temperature should be.

Haven't experienced the Bitches Brew album? Two 40th anniversary editions of Miles Davis' Bitches Brew -- a Legacy Edition and a deluxe Collector's Edition -- will be available Tuesday, August 31.

The newly created ale is designed, according to Dogfish founder and president Sam Calagione, ""as the ultimate partner for chili or spicy curry chicken"" and best enjoyed ""sipped cool, not cold, from a snifter or red wine glass while listening to the Bitches Brew album.""

Calagione was drawn to the alchemical spirits in Bitches Brew right out of college, acquiring a copy of the album ""within months of the first time I brewed a batch of homebrew in my apartment in New York City. I listened to it when I was writing my Dogfish business plan. I wanted Dogfish Head to be a maniacally inventive and creative brewery, analog beer for the digital age. You could say that my dream was to have Dogfish Head, in some small way, stand for the same thing in the beer world that Bitches Brew stands for in the jazz world. You can imagine how excited we are to be doing this project 17 years after I wrote that business plan.""

""There's a spirit of innovation, of creativity and individuality, thats at the core of Miles' music,"" said Adam Block, Senior Vice President and General Manager, Legacy Recordings. ""Sam and Dogfish Head approach their art from the same place and consequently the marriage is an easy and cool one.""

Dogfish Head and its ""off-centered ales for off-centered people"" were the subject of ""A Better Brew,"" an article in The New Yorker (Nov. 24, 2008) examining the rise of extreme beer. ""Beer has lagged well behind wine and organic produce in the ongoing reinvention of American cuisine. Yet the change over the past twenty years has been startling,"" wrote Burkhard Bilger. ""Dogfish is something of a mascot for this unruly movement. In the thirteen years since Calagione founded the brewery, it has gone from being the smallest in the country to the thirty-eighth largest. Calagione makes more beer with at least ten per cent alcohol than any other brewer, and his odd ingredients are often drawn from ancient or obscure beer traditions. It is to Budweiser what a bouillabaisse is to fish stock.""","http://res.cloudinary.com/ratebeer/image/upload/w_250,c_limit/beer_124599.jpg"

Like all the great traditional brewing towns, our home, Victor, Idaho, is in or near some of the

quality water.

Our Double Vision Doppelbock is brewed with Idaho 2-Row Pale and German Munich, Cara-

provide a dark leather color with ruby notes, a luxurious tan head, and a bready aroma with

lager yeast from a monastery brewery near Munich.  In the traditional manner, Double Vision 
is fermented cold (48F) and lagered a full 12 weeks for smoothness.  At 8.0% alcohol by 
volume, it is a deceptively drinkable springtime warmer.

The 17th century Paulist monks of Munich were allowed no solid food during their twice-yearly 
fasts.  They brewed an especially nourishing strong dark lager they called liquid bread and 
named Holy Father to help them through the Lenten and Advent fasts.  The beer was known 
as a doppelbock, which signifies a strong lager.  Since bock also means billy goat in German, 
these beers are often decorated with images of gallivanting goats.  

Double Vision's slightly burnt caramel flavor and malt sweetness make it an incredible match 
for gamevenison, moose, duck, goose, and wild boarespecially when prepared with fruity 
sauces or reductions.  Try it with pork and sauted apples, roasted root vegetables, sweet

Spoilage was common and one way to prevent the loss of beer was to add more hops to the existing recipe, which are an excellent natural preservative. The addition of more hops made pale ales stronger with a higher alcohol content. Basically, India Pale Ales are stronger over hopped versions of it's cousin, the Pale Ale. The style has grown very popular in this country over the years and can be found all around. Our IPA is more aggressive than most with a high hop aroma. The taste is a true hop bomb.

We looked to coax complexity out of the marriage of a barrel's soul and a brew's potential, not just to bomb a huge beer with huge flavor. The rum that lives in these barrels for four years integrates its spice to the wood so well that it ends up reminiscent of a Bananas Foster. A sturdy brown honey porter seemed the best host to receive the ghosts from Shipwreck's old home. We started with a base of deep malts looking for notes of coffee and chocolate, then enhanced them with the floral bouquet of local wildflower honey and the preservative strength of 10% ABV while keeping the body sensible. This was put in the casks to meld with the vanilla, wood, and spice notes, toned down by the oxidative effect of a year in the cellar.

All of the additional production effort is easily rewarded for those who love stouts specializing in dark roasted and chocolate flavors.  Over 15% of this finished brew was created by a confluence of darker specialty grains chosen to be just under the whoa, that is an intense flavor threshold.  Vlad drinks remarkably balanced given the higher alcohol and dark malt additions with flavors of rounded baker's chocolate and dark roasted coffee.  We also used a new ingredient to us: chocolate wheat, to help create the lasting thick tan foam head that invites you to the next warming sip out of your favorite tasting glass. 
Warrior hops were chosen as the sole hop in this brew and were only added to create a rounded bitterness to compliment all that dark malty sweetness.

Cyclone Zach is an intense beer, both in its brewing and flavor profile. Six mashes, rather than the usual two, were required to create this brew, leading to round the clock brewing. Boasting a 10.1% ABV Zach is truly a big and bold beer, but his most important characteristic is smoothness. To create Zach's silky smooth flavor, the brewers combined extra tank conditioning time with the addition of the most flaked oat ever used in a Storm brew, to balance the otherwise over intense roasted backbone of the beer.

This isn't to suggest that very long periods of maturation in oak automatically lead to good beer. Far from it. In fact, some of our favorite beers we've made have achieved some really nice characteristics in just a few months. However, we're really pleased with the way Sherry Barrel Atrial Rubicite turned out and are happy it received all the time it did.

The base beer for Sherry Barrel Atrial Rubicite was brewed in 2013. After maturing in oak barrels for about a year, it was blended during the spring of 2014 and refermented with raspberries. It was then racked to a single 500 liter Spanish sherry barrel for further aging and maturation. In July of 2015, fifteen months later, we racked the beer out of the sherry barrel and bottled it. All together, Sherry Barrel Atrial Rubicite took a little over two years to make. Again, this isn't to suggest that long periods of fermentation and maturation necessarily equate to enjoyable beer, but in this case, we think it does.

Sherry Barrel Atrial Rubicite was brewed with Hill Country well water, barley, wheat, oats, and hops. It was fermented with our mixed culture of microorganisms consisting of brewers yeast and native yeast and bacteria harvested from the air and wildflowers around our brewery, and refermented with raspberries grown in Washington. Sherry Barrel Atrial Rubicite was pakagd in July of 2015 and is unfiltered, unpasteurized, and 100% naturally conditioned. At the time of bottling, it was 7.0% alcohol by volume, 1.003 specific gravity (0.75 degrees Plato), 7 IBU, and 3.3 pH.

Bire de Blanc du Bois is the creation of Adrienne Ballou, Head of the Barrel Program at Jester King. Adrienne came to us about two years ago, having previously studied viticulture at U.C. Davis and worked in the wine industry in France. During her time at Jester King, she has implemented numerous wine making techniques into our fermentations, including our use of punch downs during our fruit refermentations. Punch downs lead to better flavor and color extraction from the fruit during refermentation and aid in keeping acetic acid development (think vinegar) at bay. Bire de Blanc du Bois is one of the special projects that Adrienne has worked on over the last several months. Here is her description of the inspiration, process, and presentation:","http://res.cloudinary.com/ratebeer/image/upload/w_250,c_limit/beer_305380.jpg"

TEXAS,11,Jester King Bire de Syrah,Sour/Wild Ale,Jester King Brewery,32,99.0,96.0,3.87,7.3,219.0,3.97,9.0,"We are pleased to introduce Jester King Bire de Syrah  a barrel-aged sour beer refermented with Syrah grapes. Bire de Syrah consists of a blend of beer fermented in oak barrels for nine to twelve months with our mixed culture of brewers yeast and native yeast and bacteria harvested from the air and wildflowers around our brewery. The blend was then refermented with Syrah grapes for about two weeks, transferred off of the fruit, then aged for an additional nine months in oak barrels. After packaging, the beer naturally conditioned for an additional two months prior to release. Altogether, Bire de Syrah is roughly two years old.

Bire de Syrah spent considerably more time aging than most of our other fruited sour beers. This is due to the fact that our Barrel Program Head Adrienne Ballou likes the practice of racking (transferring) beer refermented with wine grapes back into oak barrels for further maturation. Adrienne came to Jester King from the wine world and brought several winemaking techniques with her. According to Adrienne, maturation in oak barrels following fruit refermentation allows the beer to take on more complex characteristics than just bright fruit character and acidity.

The grapes used in the refermentation of Bire de Syrah came from the 2014 harvest in California. We attempt to use native Texas fruit whenever possible, but in this case, we had difficultly sourcing Texas grapes last year. Most of the grapes from the 2014 Texas harvest went to winemakers. Fortunately, we've developed some great relationships with wineries in our area, so hopefully this will be the last time we source grapes from California, or anywhere outside of Texas.

Bire de Syrah was brewed with Hill Country well water, barley, wheat, oats, and hops. It was fermented with our mixed culture of brewers yeast and native yeast and bacteria harvested from the Texas Hill Country prior to refermentation with Syrah grapes.

The resulting flavor is a smooth, rich dark chocolate, ripe red raspberry and delicate notes of vanilla and bourbon.","http://res.cloudinary.com/ratebeer/image/upload/w_250,c_limit/beer_339130.jpg"

ADJUNCTS: 60 lbs of Local Wildflower Honey from Burnside Farms

HOPS: Hop Union Experimental Variety, Mosaic, Simcoe, Cascade

ABV: 8.5%

BACK STORY:

Here at DC Brau we love our hoppy beers. This is our latest attempt in seeing how many hops we can fit into a DIPA and I think we've hit a new mark. This beer clocks in around 100 IBU, similar to OTWOA but uses 4 different varieties instead of 1. Alpha-Domina-Mellis was also brewed with 30 lbs of Wildflower honey from Burnside Farms in Haymarket, VA that was added at the end of the 90 min boil and then 30 lbs added directly into the fermenter on the second day of primary fermentation.

TASTING NOTES:

Alpha-Domina-Mellis leads in with a peach-like color and a distinctive tropical / pineapple like nose with a hint of breadiness. Mouthfeel is light and crisp with a huge, lingering bitterness provided by the huge dose of experimental hops that were added early in the boil. What the drinker is left with is a bitterness that won't quit followed by a heavy tropical, fruity, ""juicy fruit"" bubblegum like aroma with a lingering aroma reminiscent of star fruit and stone fruit.","http://res.cloudinary.com/ratebeer/image/upload/w_250,c_limit/beer_233588.jpg"

""For Others"" was brewed according to one of Shortley's homebrew recipes that DC Brau head brewer and president Jeff Hancock reworked for a commercial batch size. ""We wanted to do something special for Rob,"" said DC Brau CEO Brandon Skall. ""He's been helping out the brewery for a really long time. He's a part of the Brau family. That said, we definitely made him work for it."" On the day of brewing, Shortley showed up bright and early and started hauling sacks of grain. Afterward, Skall had him clean out the 1,200 pounds of spent grain that went into the brew.

The name For Others is a nod to Shortley's alma mater, Gonzaga College High School, the motto of which is ""Men for Others. The private academy has been a Washington, DC fixture since 1821.

Though the beer was brewed specifically for the Shortley wedding, DC Brau will be also be distributing For Others city-wide, as well as to Virginia, starting October 14th. ""I think we put a new spin on an old adage,"" said Skall. ""Something old, something new, something borrowed, and something brewed.""

""For Others"" is an intense, all-Citra hopped, double IPA - weighing in at around 8.2% ABV. Available from the brewery in growlers-only or on-draft from bars and restaurants.","http://res.cloudinary.com/ratebeer/image/upload/w_250,c_limit/beer_188591.jpg"

This beer is unfiltered and unpasteurized and is partially bottle conditioned therefore it may have a small amount of yeast sediment on the bottom of the bottle.  We suggest letting this beer warm up slightly from refrigeration temperature then pour into 2 clean clear pint glasses roughing the beer up a bit (pour aggressively) at the end of each pour to bring up a nice thick head.  You may reserve any sediment and dispose or drink it - please don't be afraid of sediment!  It is the result of living yeast and is yummy.
