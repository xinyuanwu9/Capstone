After fermentation we brought in some bourbon barrels to age the stout.  One hundred and fifty days later, Bourbon County Stout was born-A liquid as dark and dense as a black hole with a thick foam the color of bourbon barrels.  The nose is a mix of charred oak, vanilla,carmel and smoke.  One sip has more flavor than your average case of beer.  It overpowers anything in the room.

Like all the great traditional brewing towns, our home, Victor, Idaho, is in or near some of the 
world’s best barley- and hop-growing regions, and is distinguished by an ample supply of top-
quality water.

Our Double Vision Doppelbock is brewed with Idaho 2-Row Pale and German Munich, Cara-
Aroma, CaraMunich and de-husked Carafa malts to an original gravity of 22˚ Plato.  The malts 
provide a dark leather color with ruby notes, a luxurious tan head, and a bready aroma with 
a hint of smoke.  It is lightly spiced with German Hallertau Tradition hops and fermented with 
lager yeast from a monastery brewery near Munich.  In the traditional manner, Double Vision 
is fermented cold (48˚F) and lagered a full 12 weeks for smoothness.  At 8.0% alcohol by 
volume, it is a deceptively drinkable springtime warmer.

The 17th century Paulist monks of Munich were allowed no solid food during their twice-yearly 
fasts.  They brewed an especially nourishing strong dark lager they called “liquid bread” and 
named “Holy Father” to help them through the Lenten and Advent fasts.  The beer was known 
as a doppelbock, which signifies a strong lager.  Since “bock” also means “billy goat” in German, 
these beers are often decorated with images of gallivanting goats.  

Double Vision’s slightly burnt caramel flavor and malt sweetness make it an incredible match 
for game—venison, moose, duck, goose, and wild boar—especially when prepared with fruity 
sauces or reductions.  Try it with pork and sautéed apples, roasted root vegetables, sweet 
sausages, ham or prosciutto.  It’s wonderful with cheese and dessert, too.  Pair it with an aged 
gruyère, a caramel flan, or a crème brûlée."

Haven’t experienced the Bitches Brew album? Two 40th anniversary editions of Miles Davis’ Bitches Brew -- a Legacy Edition and a deluxe Collector’s Edition -- will be available Tuesday, August 31.

The newly created ale is designed, according to Dogfish founder and president Sam Calagione, ""as the ultimate partner for chili or spicy curry chicken"" and best enjoyed ""sipped cool, not cold, from a snifter or red wine glass while listening to the Bitches Brew album.""

Calagione was drawn to the alchemical spirits in Bitches Brew right out of college, acquiring a copy of the album ""within months of the first time I brewed a batch of homebrew in my apartment in New York City. I listened to it when I was writing my Dogfish business plan. I wanted Dogfish Head to be a maniacally inventive and creative brewery, analog beer for the digital age. You could say that my dream was to have Dogfish Head, in some small way, stand for the same thing in the beer world that Bitches Brew stands for in the jazz world. You can imagine how excited we are to be doing this project 17 years after I wrote that business plan.""

""There’s a spirit of innovation, of creativity and individuality, thats at the core of Miles’ music,"" said Adam Block, Senior Vice President and General Manager, Legacy Recordings. ""Sam and Dogfish Head approach their art from the same place and consequently the marriage is an easy and cool one.""

Dogfish Head and its ""off-centered ales for off-centered people"" were the subject of ""A Better Brew,"" an article in The New Yorker (Nov. 24, 2008) examining the rise of extreme beer. ""Beer has lagged well behind wine and organic produce in the ongoing reinvention of American cuisine. Yet the change over the past twenty years has been startling,"" wrote Burkhard Bilger. ""Dogfish is something of a mascot for this unruly movement. In the thirteen years since Calagione founded the brewery, it has gone from being the smallest in the country to the thirty-eighth largest. Calagione makes more beer with at least ten per cent alcohol than any other brewer, and his odd ingredients are often drawn from ancient or obscure beer traditions. It is to Budweiser what a bouillabaisse is to fish stock."""

Nearly without exception, the darker, richer and more alcoholic a brew is, the warmer the serving temperature should be.

Here’s to 20 more years of punishing livers everywhere.

Named after the region of Hawaii from which it hails, Ka’u is produced from some of the world’s rarest coffee beans. Slow-grown beneficiaries of nutrient-rich volcanic soil and idyllic climate, Ka’u offers nuances of caramel and hazelnut plus a soft floral character, all of which marry seamlessly with natural sweetness from the vanilla and coconut as well as Speedway Stout’s inherently rich, chocolaty character.

This beer begins in spring when oat seeds are sown as soon as the
soil can be worked. Meanwhile, select types of barley are planted with
hopes that Mother Nature will be kind. Our brewers wait patiently until
the legumes are mature and ready for the scythe. Upon delivery to the
brewery, these ingredients are mixed together in the mash tun where
they steep, creating a rich molasses-like liquid. Spicy hops are boiled
with the thick brew, giving balance and complexity. Brewers yeast feasts
upon the rich sugars, concluding its transformation into oatmeal stout.
Pour Oat into a snifter, allow its thick tan head to slowly rise, releasing
unbridled aromas. The color of Oat is as dark as a moonless night. The
first sip reveals Oat’s thick and nourishing taste. Like a haversack to a
horse, a bottle of this stout is a meal in itself. Enjoy responsibly.

The extended aging allowed seasonal temperature fluctuations in the barrels to draw bold flavors from the oak that can only develop with time. The heat of the bourbon gave way to a subtle caramel sweetness, and the bold, sharp edges of the roasted malt mellowed and married with notes of vanilla and oak. Belgian Candi Sugar in the kettle created a layer of dark fruit complexity and a dry finish."

This beer is all about the hops; we use a blend of five different varieties all grown in the Pacific Northwest.  A small charge of Chinook and Columbus early in the boil adds a smooth bitterness.  A majority of the hops are then added late in the kettle or post-fermentation to produce a beer that is heavy on hop flavor and aroma.  The combination of Cascade, Centennial, Citra and Columbus give Head High a noticeable grapefruit flavor with aromas of citrus, tropical fruits and pine.  Our house American ale yeast ferments to a dry finish that accentuates the use of imported Pilsner and lightly kilned crystal malt resulting in Head High’s straw color and crisp flavor."

We looked to coax complexity out of the marriage of a barrel’s soul and a brew’s potential, not just to bomb a huge beer with huge flavor. The rum that lives in these barrels for four years integrates its spice to the wood so well that it ends up reminiscent of a Bananas Foster. A sturdy brown honey porter seemed the best host to receive the ghosts from Shipwreck’s old home. We started with a base of deep malts looking for notes of coffee and chocolate, then enhanced them with the floral bouquet of local wildflower honey and the preservative strength of 10% ABV while keeping the body sensible. This was put in the casks to meld with the vanilla, wood, and spice notes, toned down by the oxidative effect of a year in the cellar. Drink Shipwreck Porter because a barrel should be so much more than a depth charge."

Beer was made in England and sent to the stationed troops. Pale ales were popular beers at the time and had to endure a six month journey to the distant country. Spoilage was common and one way to prevent the loss of beer was to add more hops to the existing recipe, which are an excellent natural preservative. The addition of more hops made pale ales stronger with a higher alcohol content. Basically, India Pale Ales are stronger over hopped versions of it's cousin, the Pale Ale. The style has grown very popular in this country over the years and can be found all around. Our IPA is more aggressive than most with a high hop aroma. The taste is a true hop bomb.

Biere Joi’s malt bill might bear a familiar resemblance to a Belgian Trappists’ Dubbel, if it were not for the beer’s generous quantity of French Coffee malt and the insane amount of Belgian dark candi sugar. After fermentation, Biere Joi is next racked into whiskey barrels and aged with Mello Joy French roast coffee, cacao nibs and Chile d’arbol peppers. The eclectic fusing of malt, caramel, coffee, chocolate and Chile peppers makes for a unique pint in this relatively light bodied, around 7.5% percent ABV beer.

We like to pair the coffee and chocolate forward Biere Joi with a savory pastry, like Tasso and Pepper-Jack cheese scones, or a traditional Cajun pork meat pie. Biere Joi is also nice with heavily sauced barbequed pork or chicken, bread pudding, or Bananas Foster.

""For Others"" was brewed according to one of Shortley’s homebrew recipes that DC Brau head brewer and president Jeff Hancock reworked for a commercial batch size. ""We wanted to do something special for Rob,"" said DC Brau CEO Brandon Skall. ""He’s been helping out the brewery for a really long time. He’s a part of the Brau family. That said, we definitely made him work for it."" On the day of brewing, Shortley showed up bright and early and started hauling sacks of grain. Afterward, Skall had him clean out the 1,200 pounds of spent grain that went into the brew.

The name “For Others” is a nod to Shortley’s alma mater, Gonzaga College High School, the motto of which is ""Men for Others.” The private academy has been a Washington, DC fixture since 1821.

Though the beer was brewed specifically for the Shortley wedding, DC Brau will be also be distributing “For Others” city-wide, as well as to Virginia, starting October 14th. ""I think we put a new spin on an old adage,"" said Skall. ""Something old, something new, something borrowed, and something brewed.""

""For Others"" is an intense, all-Citra hopped, double IPA - weighing in at around 8.2% ABV. Available from the brewery in growlers-only or on-draft from bars and restaurants."

BACK STORY:

Here at DC Brau we love our hoppy beers. This is our latest attempt in seeing how many hops we can fit into a DIPA and I think we’ve hit a new mark. This beer clocks in around 100 IBU, similar to OTWOA but uses 4 different varieties instead of 1. Alpha-Domina-Mellis was also brewed with 30 lbs of Wildflower honey from Burnside Farms in Haymarket, VA that was added at the end of the 90 min boil and then 30 lbs added directly into the fermenter on the second day of primary fermentation.

TASTING NOTES:

Alpha-Domina-Mellis leads in with a peach-like color and a distinctive tropical / pineapple like nose with a hint of breadiness. Mouthfeel is light and crisp with a huge, lingering bitterness provided by the huge dose of experimental hops that were added early in the boil. What the drinker is left with is a bitterness that won’t quit followed by a heavy tropical, fruity, ""juicy fruit"" bubblegum like aroma with a lingering aroma reminiscent of star fruit and stone fruit."

Bière de Syrah consists of a blend of beer fermented in oak barrels for nine to twelve months with our mixed culture of brewers yeast and native yeast and bacteria harvested from the air and wildflowers around our brewery. The blend was then refermented with Syrah grapes for about two weeks, transferred off of the fruit, then aged for an additional nine months in oak barrels. After packaging, the beer naturally conditioned for an additional two months prior to release. Altogether, Bière de Syrah is roughly two years old.

Bière de Syrah spent considerably more time aging than most of our other fruited sour beers. This is due to the fact that our Barrel Program Head Adrienne Ballou likes the practice of racking (transferring) beer refermented with wine grapes back into oak barrels for further maturation. Adrienne came to Jester King from the wine world and brought several winemaking techniques with her. According to Adrienne, maturation in oak barrels following fruit refermentation allows the beer to take on more complex characteristics than just bright fruit character and acidity.

The grapes used in the refermentation of Bière de Syrah came from the 2014 harvest in California. We attempt to use native Texas fruit whenever possible, but in this case, we had difficultly sourcing Texas grapes last year. Most of the grapes from the 2014 Texas harvest went to winemakers. Fortunately, we’ve developed some great relationships with wineries in our area, so hopefully this will be the last time we source grapes from California, or anywhere outside of Texas.

Bière de Syrah was brewed with Hill Country well water, barley, wheat, oats, and hops. It was fermented with our mixed culture of brewers yeast and native yeast and bacteria harvested from the Texas Hill Country prior to refermentation with Syrah grapes. It is unfiltered, unpasteurized, and 100% naturally conditioned in bottles, kegs, and casks. Bière de Syrah is 7.3% alcohol by volume, 9 IBU, 3.2 pH at the time of packaging in June 2015, and has a finishing gravity of 1.001 (0.25 degrees Plato)."

Davis and worked in the wine industry in France. During her time at Jester King, she has implemented numerous wine making techniques into our fermentations, including our use of punch downs during our fruit refermentations. Punch downs lead to better flavor and color extraction from the fruit during refermentation and aid in keeping acetic acid development (think vinegar) at bay.

However, we’re really pleased with the way Sherry Barrel Atrial Rubicite turned out and are happy it received all the time it did.

The base beer for Sherry Barrel Atrial Rubicite was brewed in 2013. After maturing in oak barrels for about a year, it was blended during the spring of 2014 and refermented with raspberries. It was then racked to a single 500 liter Spanish sherry barrel for further aging and maturation. In July of 2015, fifteen months later, we racked the beer out of the sherry barrel and bottled it. All together, Sherry Barrel Atrial Rubicite took a little over two years to make. Again, this isn’t to suggest that long periods of fermentation and maturation necessarily equate to enjoyable beer, but in this case, we think it does.

Sherry Barrel Atrial Rubicite was brewed with Hill Country well water, barley, wheat, oats, and hops.

This clever idea produced 26 different beers ranging widely in taste, complexity, and lack of sleep for our brewers! We traveled through the alphabet, with no shortcuts, starting with Alyssa and now introducing, the last letter ‘Z’ for Zach, an imperial oatmeal stout.

Cyclone Zach is an intense beer, both in its brewing and flavor profile. Six mashes, rather than the usual two, were required to create this brew, leading to round the clock brewing. Boasting a 10.1% ABV Zach is truly a big and bold beer, but his most important characteristic is smoothness. To create Zach’s silky smooth flavor, the brewers combined extra tank conditioning time with the addition of the most flaked oat ever used in a Storm brew, to balance the otherwise over intense roasted backbone of the beer. This Cyclone will stand up to the test of time, our Brew Master recommends aging this beer for years to come."

A custom blend of Narragansett’s bittersweet milk stout with dark, delicious Autocrat Coffee makes for a delightful beer that is more Rhode Island than Roger Williams himself. Since the 1890’s, Narragansett Beer and Autocrat Coffee have been home-grown Rhode Island favorites. With more than 100 years of shared heritage, the two local legends joined forces to celebrate the art of craft brewing and bring New England an emblematic brew that pays homage to their history. The full-bodied milk stout is enriched with the robust flavor of Autocrat Coffee to achieve an extraordinary taste experience. Brewed under the supervision of award-winning Brewmaster Sean Larkin, Narragansett’s Autocrat Coffee Milk Stout delivers a flavorful, smooth, dark brew with notes of roasted barley, chocolate malt and rich crystal malt. The exacting touch of hops provides just the right amount of bitterness to balance the sweet notes of the malts and milk sugar."

Further, extra tank conditioning time was required to create the smoothness.
All of the additional production effort is easily rewarded for those who love stouts specializing in dark roasted and chocolate flavors.  Over 15% of this finished brew was created by a confluence of darker specialty grains chosen to be just under the “whoa, that is an intense flavor” threshold.  Vlad drinks remarkably balanced given the higher alcohol and dark malt additions with flavors of rounded baker’s chocolate and dark roasted coffee.  We also used a new ingredient to us: chocolate wheat, to help create the lasting thick tan foam head that invites you to the next warming sip out of your favorite tasting glass. 
Warrior hops were chosen as the sole hop in this brew and were only added to create a rounded bitterness to compliment all that dark malty sweetness.  The emphasis with this brew are the waves of chocolate, roasted, cherry, coffee, and finishing roasted flavors that will almost pleasingly overwhelm you."
